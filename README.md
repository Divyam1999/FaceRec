The proposed system is a facial recognition-based attendance system. The system is designed to be used on a computer with a camera attached to it. In this system facial data of individuals will be stored in the system and then the system will be trained to identify those images. Post training the attendance will be taken using the camera. The camera will click continuous pictures and try to find faces in each picture using the ‘harrcascade’ facial features. Once it finds the picture the picture will be extracted to a grey image which will pe compared with the trained data. Now if system is trained for the detected face it will mark the attendance to the person and for faces which the system is not trained then those images will be added to the unknown persons list to provide the information that the system has detected some unusual faces. The name, id, time and date of people who have been marked present by the attendance system is saved in a csv file. 
The above system provides a nice Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the users to use the application the user can easily add records, train records and take attendance.
